# Adaptive AI Learning Assistant (AURA) – Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement
Students across domains such as Engineering, Medicine (MBBS), and Research struggle with
unclear learning paths, scattered resources, lack of mentorship, and limited awareness of
relevant opportunities like internships and scholarships.

**The Gap**: Existing learning platforms provide generic, one-size-fits-all content that doesn't adapt to individual goals, current knowledge level, or academic context. This leads to inefficient learning, wasted time, and missed opportunities.

**Market Impact**: 
- Many of the students report feeling overwhelmed by learning choices
- Average student spends 40% more time than necessary due to unfocused study plans
- Most of the relevant internships and scholarships go unnoticed by eligible students
